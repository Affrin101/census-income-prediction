### Pledge for our community

To foster an open community of contributors, we respect all volunteers regardless of their level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

### Community guidelines

-   Acknowledge the time and effort of the volunteers
-   Be open to constructive criticism
-   Receptively accept differing views

-   Use welcoming and inclusive language

### Examples of unacceptable behavior

-   Any kind of harassment of any of the participants
-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
-   Indulging in inappropriate social contact, violent threats or language directed against another person

### Repercussions

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the project Code of Conduct team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or reporting them to the course instructors at tiffany.timbers@stat.ubc.ca. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Moral obligations and responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

The Code of Conduct applies to the following people both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community:

-   admins of the online space
-   maintainers
-   reviewers
-   contributors
-   all community members

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
