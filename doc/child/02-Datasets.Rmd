# Methods

## Data

The data set used in this project is the Census Income Dataset, which is also known as the Adult dataset, and was created in 1996. It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the data was extracted by Barry Becker using the 1994 Census database and details of which could be found [here](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).

In this dataset, each row represents a single sample from the census, which include the demographic data of a resident. We are going to dig into the data and explore more about the relationship between hen demographic features and their income level below.

The training data set has 32561 observations, and no observation with `NULL` value is found in the raw data. In the test data, there are 16281 entries. So the train-test split is roughly 2:1, i.e. the test split is taking up around 33% of the entire data set. Below is a glimpse of few rows from our training set and information about the datatypes and count of records in each feature.

```{r train-head, message=False, warning=False}
train_head  <- read.csv("../../results/eda/train_head.csv") 

knitr::kable(train_head, caption = "Table 1.0 Displaying the first 5 rows of the training dataset")

```

```{r train-info, message=False, warning=False}
train_info <- read.csv("../../results/eda/train_info.csv") 

knitr::kable(train_info, caption = "Table 1.1 to display information about the datatypes and to check for any missing values")

```

When we checked the statistical summary of each features, we found that there were missing value in this data set which was represented by `?`. On further analysis, we found that there are 1836 missing values in `workclass`, 1843 in `occupation`, and 583 in `native_country`. As part of data cleaning and wrangling, we replaced `?` with `NaN`.

\
During the analysis of the target column, we observed there are 24720 observations with annual income less than 50K, which is around 76% of the training data and there are 7841 samples with income more than 50K, which takes up around 24%. We could see class imbalance here, and we might need to do extra steps to assess the effect of the problem with the precision and recall. The uneven distribution of class has been represented below.

```{r class-imbalance-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Class imbalance and uneven distribution of the training data predictors", out.width = '100%' }

knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/class_imbalnce.png")
```

When we performed an initial sanity check on the test dataset, we found that all the columns in the test data were of object type. We had to perform some additional steps to change the data types of some of the features like `age`, `fnlwgt` to the numeric columns, to make it suitable for testing purposes afterwards.

## Analysis

In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we tried to assess the importance of each feature towards the prediction of the income level. We visualized the the distribution of features(both numerical and categorical) to check if there was potential bias in the data set so that we could carry out suitable processing pipeline to different features.

### Visualising numerical features

#### Distribution

Here we are visualizing the distribution of each numeric feature of each target class. The blue color represents the group with annual income \<=50K USD, where the orange color represents the counterpart.

```{r numerical-feature-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. Distribution of numerical features.", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/numerical_plot.png")
```

From the plots above, we can see that the features `age`, `education_num`, `hours_per_week` are the major features which are demarcating the difference between the two classes clearly

Below, we are visualizing key numeric features against the target class and basically want to look out for any outliers and statistical measures of the data.

```{r statistical-summary, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3. Statistical summary of numerical features.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/stat_summary.png")
```

Similar to numeric features, we would want to explore the categorical features to observe the frequencies of each feature which may affect the performance of model on detecting any of the target class.

```{r categorical-feature-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 4.  Distribution of categorical features", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/categorical_plot.png")
```

n particular, since `native_country` has too many different values, and the majority of the sample are from the United States, we are exploring the feature as a binary feature here, and we could see the United States still have the supermajority in this feature.

```{r country-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 5. Distribution of income based on country(USA vs others).", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/country_native.png")
```

The R and Python programming languages [@R; @Python] and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis: caret [@caret], docopt [@docopt], feather [@featherr], knitr [@knitr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], docopt [@docoptpython], os [@Python], feather [@featherpy] Pandas [@mckinney-proc-scipy-2010].
