As we progress into the future, it has become imperative to earn high to be able to lead a good lifestyle along with enjoying luxuries. People are curious to know what factors affect their income and based on this analysis, how they can take decisions in their lives to earn more. 

Sometimes people are not sure how the level of schooling, the number of hours they dedicate to their work, their marital status  and other factors affect their annual income. To determine this, here we ask if we can use a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a person will earn more than 50K annually based on these factors or not. Having an understanding of whether they will be able to earn more than 50K based on some factors, can help people tweak their career decisions early in life and come up with a plan that can help them earn more in future. [@chakrabarty2018statistical] Thus, if a machine learning algorithm can accurately and effectively predict whether a person will earn more than 50K annually, this could help people make better decisions early in their life, until things go out of their hands.
